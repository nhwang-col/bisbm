biSBM - a method for community detection in bipartite networks, based on the publication: 
	"Efficiently inferring community structure in bipartite networks"
	Daniel B. Larremore, Aaron Clauset, and Abigail Z. Jacobs 
	Physical Review E 90(1), 012805 (2014).

/***** MATLAB vs R vs C++ *****/

This file explains how to use the pure MATLAB version of the biSBM code. If you prefer using a wrapper in R or just pure C++, see README_R.txt or README_cplusplus.txt.

v1.1 - Increased the maximum number of edges to 10,000,000, maximum number of vertices to 1,000,000, and maximum number of communities to 1,000. Code now exits if Log(x) for x<0 is called, instead of just warning. 


/***** I. Installation *****/

The implementation of the biSBM algorithm described in the paper is written in C++ using a MATLAB mex file. Please see MATLAB documentation for installation or troubleshooting of mex files or MATLAB.

1. Place the files 
	biSBM.m
	biSBM.h
	biSBM_MATLAB.cpp
	-----
	example_MATLAB.m
	southernWomen.edgelist
	southernWomen.types
	test.edgelist
	test.types
into the MATLAB directory of your choice. 

2. Compile the biSBMcore.cpp in MATLAB by typing
	mex biSBM_MATLAB.cpp
which should produce the message
	MEX completed successfully.

This procedure has been tested using MATLAB R2014a and OSX 10.9.2. There are known issues for various combinations of MATLAB and OSX / XCode. These are beyond the scope of this installation, but solutions are searchable online.
